## Realtime Dashboard page

This page gives you a bird eye view of your servers and applications, in realtime (updated every seconds).

## Condensed dashboard

If you run a lot of servers and applications, the condensed feature allows you to minify each application widget in order to get a more concentrated overview:

You can also notice the + and - button. This lets you scale the dashboard interface depending on your screen resolution.

## Cross metrics overview

Once you have [added custom metrics](http://docs.keymetrics.io/docs/pages/custom-metrics/#expose-metrics-measure-anything) and in the case you are managing a fleet of multiple servers, you may want to analyze the custom metrics of each application through the multiple servers it is hosted in. To get this special overview, you need to select the right application in the select box on the top of the dashboard:
